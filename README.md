# PointCloud_proscesing
This repository contains the implemented algorithms in Python, to estimate the plant indices and attributes of reconstructions of crops. That information was saved in .cvs format and is processed using pandas library.

## Use of software
For use the Software, use an integrated development environment (IDE) of Python 3.0 as **Spyder3** to open ParametrosMorfologicos.py located in:
> ProcessingAlgorithms/ParametrosMorfologicos.py
The **path** of .cvs where file is located, the **file name** and the **$z_{ref}$** must be write by user. When the information is correct, the Python file can be run.

## Menu of software
Once the softwere is runing, the basic information of file is printed in command windows as:
- Size of file (rows & colums)
- Information of 'x', 'y' and 'z' above of $z_{ref}$
