## Use of software
For use the Software, use an integrated development environment (IDE) of Python 3.7 as **Spyder3** to open ParametrosMorfologicos.py located in:
> ProcessingAlgorithms/ParametrosMorfologicos.py

The **path** of .cvs where file is located, the **file_name** and the $\bf z_{ref}$ must be write by user. When the information is correct, the Python file can be run.
## Menu of software
Once the software is running, the instructions and menu of commands are printed on command windows ,
![Instructions](/Images/Instructions.PNG)
 to show hoy  the basic information of file is printed in command windows as:
- Size of file (rows & columns)
